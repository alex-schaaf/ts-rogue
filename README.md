# ts-rogue

`ts-rogue` is the working title of a 2D roguelike game which I use as an excuse
to figure out interesting game mechanics and how to implement them without
creating a big ball of mud.

- [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/), the roguelike toolkit for JS,
  is used for abstracting away the ASCII rendering.
